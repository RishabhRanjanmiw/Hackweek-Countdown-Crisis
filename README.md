#  HackWeek Countdown Crisis

A responsive Next.js web app for HackWeek, showing COSC (CBIT Open Source Community) info from a local JSON file and a **live countdown timer** until HackWeek ends.

##  Fixes Made

- Fixed import errors and missing file structure
- Created and populated `cosc.json` with event info
- Rendered JSON data in `CommunityInfo.js`
- Built a real-time countdown timer component (`Countdown.js`)
- Ensured zero console warnings or errors
- Deployed successfully to Vercel
